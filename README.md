# Purpose

This purpose of this project is to analyze seed genes of interest for a target disease. Then, a protein-protein interaction network can be assembeled to visualize interactions key to this abnormal phenotype. Next, eQTLs were found to target the sites of polymorphisms that contribute to the disease. This allows for specific genes to be targeted for further research.
