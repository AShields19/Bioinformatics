# Purpose

This purpose of this project is to analyze seed genes of interest for a target disease. Then, a protein-protein interaction network can be assembeled to visualize interactions key to this abnormal phenotype. Next, eQTLs were found to target the sites of polymorphisms that contribute to the disease. This allows for specific genes to be targeted for further research.

# Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Genes of Interest

Acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, is a cancer of the bone marrow that affects the production of bone marrow and the blood. It leads to the synthesis of abnormal myeloblasts, which are immature white blood cells. It is a potentially fatal condition, with symptoms including fatigue, easy bleeding or bruising, fever, weight loss, joint and bone pain, and a weakness to infection. The requirement to diagnose AML is to have â‰¥20% myeloblasts (blasts) identified in peripheral blood or bone marrow analysis. These blasts identified during testing are a type of immature white blood cell (WBC) that go on to form differentiated WBCs such as basophils and neutrophils. In healthy individuals, blasts should be <5% of cells identified in bone marrow or peripheral blood analysis. Levels greater than 5% indicate dysfunction of myeloblasts.

Several genes are implicated in the expression of AML. In AML, these are some of the genes that are commonly found to be misexpressed, and the effects that misexpression can cause. Many of these genes have direct roles in the normal homeostatic regulation of myeloid lineage progenitor cells.
* NPM1- Disrupts normal nuclear function and localization of essential proteins for cell function
* FLT3- Activation leads to an increase in proliferation and survival of cancerous cells
* DNMT3A- Epigenetic factor that can alter gene expression via DNA methylation
* TET2- Impairs DNA methylation, leading to changes in gene expression/differentiation

# Hypothesis 
Hypothesis: An elevated blast count is caused by the cumulative effects of one or more mutated genes whose functions are crucial to maintain a normal homeostatic myeloblast cellular environment by allowing blasts that have evaded normal transcriptional regulation and sensitivity to DNA damage response pathway functionality to replicate in an uncontrolled manner.
The hypothesis would explain the diagnostic disease phenotype of a greatly elevated population of blast cells. Symptoms reported by patients also fit this hypothesis, as dysregulation of WBCs would increase the risk of infection in an individual and changing the normal composition of blood cells in the body could explain easily bruising. Fever can occur since a patient may have picked up an infection (viral or bacterial most likely), causing their body to have to fight especially hard to compensate for the reduction of mature WBCs available to fight the infection. Fever and fighting off infections cause fatigue. Since blasts normally reside in the bone marrow, bone and joint pain are not unexpected as the abnormal proliferation and possible lack of destruction of mutated blasts might be higher in number and building up. The number of cells in the confined space may be putting pressure on the bone marrow, necessitating that it expands, which would cause pain. This expansion and spilling out of blasts into the blood also explains why increased blast counts can be picked up in peripheral blood smear analysis.
