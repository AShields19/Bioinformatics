Bioinformatics Project- Group 7

# Purpose

This purpose of this project is to analyze seed genes of interest for a target disease. Then, a protein-protein interaction network can be assembeled to visualize interactions key to this abnormal phenotype. Next, eQTLs were found to target the sites of polymorphisms that contribute to the disease. This allows for specific genes to be targeted for further research.

# Acute Myeloid Leukemia and Genes of Interest

Acute myeloid leukemia, or AML, is a cancer of the bone marrow that affects the production of bone marrow and the blood. It leads to the synthesis of abnormal myeloblasts, which are immature white blood cells. It is a potentially fatal condition, with symptoms including fatigue, easy bleeding or bruising, fever, weight loss, joint and bone pain, and a weakness to infection. The requirement to diagnose AML is to have â‰¥20% myeloblasts (blasts) identified in peripheral blood or bone marrow analysis. These blasts identified during testing are a type of immature white blood cell (WBC) that go on to form differentiated WBCs such as basophils and neutrophils. In healthy individuals, blasts should be <5% of cells identified in bone marrow or peripheral blood analysis. Levels greater than 5% indicate dysfunction of myeloblasts.

Several genes are implicated in the expression of AML. In AML, these are some of the genes that are commonly found to be misexpressed, and the effects that misexpression can cause. 
* NPM1- Disrupts normal nuclear function and localization of essential proteins for cell function
* FLT3- Activation leads to an increase in proliferation and survival of cancerous cells
* DNMT3A- Epigenetic factor that can alter gene expression via DNA methylation
* TET2- Impairs DNA methylation, leading to changes in gene expression/differentiation

# Hypothesis 
Hypothesis: An elevated blast count is caused by the cumulative effects of one or more mutated genes whose functions are crucial to maintain a normal homeostatic myeloblast cellular environment by allowing blasts that have evaded normal transcriptional regulation and sensitivity to DNA damage response pathway functionality to replicate in an uncontrolled manner.
